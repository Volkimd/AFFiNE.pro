No problem! We want you to be able to enjoy [AFFiNE](https://www.affine.pro/), and take control of your data and track progress- so we have added import support from Notion. There are a few steps that need to be completed so we'll guide you through that now.\n\n## **First Method:**\n\nPlease directly follow the instructions from out Youtube Tutorial video:\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3leDjxImqM\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n## Step1.Exporting from Notion\n\nFirst thing to do is export your data from Notion.\n\n* Please make sure you export your Notion files to HTML files.\n\n* Click Include subpages button.\n\n* Then click Export button.\n\n\n![SO6agcVvrz93GYSq8zujoFoFyG0w6f7IZNWraX1SytQ=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/SO6agcVvrz93GYSq8zujoFoFyG0w6f7IZNWraX1SytQ=.webp)\n\n## Step2.Importing Into AFFiNE\n\nThe procedure is:\n\n* Head to All pages\n\n* Import page (from New Page more options)\n\n* Select your Notion `.`zip to export file\n\n\n\n## Second Method: Markdown File Import Tutorial\n\nHowever, if you are using Markdown files, please check out this video tutorial to know how to import markdown files to AFFiNE.\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehp35oXl0V8\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n### One More Thing:\n\nThe Iink to block feature will also be fully supported in the near future.\n\nNot all features are supported one-to-one but we are continuing to improve compatibility.\n\nMore discussion can be found here: [https://community.affine.pro/c/feature-requests/import-export](https://community.affine.pro/c/feature-requests/import-export)\n\nAlso very welcome to join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/Arn7TqJBvG) to have better support!\n\n#### \n\n#### **In addition:**\n\nAFFiNE is an open source alternative to Notion and Miro.
