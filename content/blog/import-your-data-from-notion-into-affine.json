No problem! We want you to be able to enjoy [AFFiNE](https://www.affine.pro/), and take control of your data and track progress- so we have added import support from Notion. There are a few steps that need to be completed so we'll guide you through that now.\n\n## Step1.Exporting from Notion\n\nFirst thing to do is export your data from Notion.\n\n* Please make sure you export your Notion files to markdown files.\n\n\n![mbp--XFJeikiwMBdA2LiyeV-65FzgHO86K3uksQRC-8=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/mbp--XFJeikiwMBdA2LiyeV-65FzgHO86K3uksQRC-8=.webp)\n\n## Step2.Importing Into AFFiNE\n\nThe procedure is:\n\n* Head to All pages\n\n* Import page (from New Page more options)\n\n* Select markdown files\n\n* Select your Notion `.md` to export file\n\n## The Latest Video Tutorial\n\nPlease check out this video tutorial to know more.\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehp35oXl0V8\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n\n\n### Things to bear in mind\n\nNot all features are supported one-to-one but we are continuing to improve compatibility. So things like Databases may not export perfectly into AFFiNE. More discussion can be found here: [https://community.affine.pro/c/feature-requests/import-export](https://community.affine.pro/c/feature-requests/import-export)\n\n#### **In addition:**\n\nAFFiNE is an open source alternative to Notion and Miro. We also have edgeless canvas features that can use and our templates feature will be online soon.\n\nFor people hesitate to use our cloud service, our open source version is a local first product you can self host it and keep all your files on your computer.
