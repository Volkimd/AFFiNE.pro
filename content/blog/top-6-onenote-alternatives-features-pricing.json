It is a next-generation knowledge base that combines the best features of popular apps such as Notion and Miro into one powerful, flexible, and user-friendly platform. AFFiNE prioritizes data security, privacy, and collaboration, making it an ideal choice for managing daily plans, personal knowledge repositories, and team projects.\n\n\n**Key features:**\n\n\n* Multiple workspaces: Create different workspaces to manage various types of data, like managing your daily tasks, personal knowledge repository, and team projects simultaneously.\n\n\n* Pages within workspaces: Organize your tasks, notes, and ideas in different pages within each workspace, making it easy to navigate and find what you need.\n\n\n* Powerful search functionality: Quickly locate the documents, tags, or actions you want with a modern search app that can handle multiple workspaces and pages.\n\n\n* Time tracking and goal setting: Use AFFiNE’s built-in features to track your time spent on tasks and set goals to improve your productivity.\n\n\n\n![kuEf4F6avCaCcEEbJMkIcwDzcWsZpyvesS22SL5qClk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/kuEf4F6avCaCcEEbJMkIcwDzcWsZpyvesS22SL5qClk=)\n\n\n* Database: With our new system, you can effortlessly generate, arrange, and monitor your everyday duties in a manner that was never before possible.

This means that users can customize the app to suit their specific needs, add new features, or fix any bugs they encounter. Furthermore, AFFiNE can foster a community of developers and contributors who can work together to improve the app's functionality and security.\n\n\n* Privacy-first: Privacy is a top concern for many users, especially regarding sensitive information such as personal notes. A privacy-first note-taking app ensures that user data is protected and not shared with third-party companies or advertisers. This can be achieved through features such as end-to-end encryption, data residency options, and user consent mechanisms. By prioritizing privacy, a note-taking app can build trust with its users and establish itself as a secure and reliable platform.\n\n\n* Local-first: A local-first note-taking app stores data locally on the user's device, rather than in the cloud. This provides several benefits, including faster access to notes, offline availability, and greater control over user data. Additionally, a local-first app can offer features such as automatic backups, version control, and seamless synchronization between devices. By prioritizing local storage, a note-taking app can provide a more reliable and robust user experience.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n* AFFiNE may not have as many features or integrations as other productivity tools.\n\n\n* Some users may prefer a cloud-first approach instead of the local-first approach offered by AFFiNE.\n\n\n\n![HuTbygf0UoeHt3E4W0UwhGFkhF81c6nkadkFyZ5kwLU=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/HuTbygf0UoeHt3E4W0UwhGFkhF81c6nkadkFyZ5kwLU=)\n\n\n**Pricing: FREE**\n\n\nAFFiNE is an exceptional task management application that is entirely free and open to all users who want to take advantage of its powerful capabilities.
