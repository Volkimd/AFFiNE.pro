  "md": "The [Cornell Note-Taking Method](https://affine.pro/blog/the-cornell-notes-template-and-system-learning-tips) is a popular and efficient way to organize and retain information, widely used by students and professionals alike. This method divides the page into three main sections: notes, cues, and summaries. The note-taking section captures the main content, while the cues section—on the left margin—often includes questions or keywords to prompt recall. The summary section at the bottom helps reinforce the main ideas.\n\n\nHowever, many users wonder whether cues in Cornell Notes must always be questions. While questions are effective, the cues can also be keywords, phrases, or even visual markers that support active recall.\n\n\nWith AFFiNE’s canvas-based note-taking app, users can go beyond the traditional Cornell Notes structure. The flexibility of AFFiNE’s canvas allows users to visually organize cues in multiple ways, incorporating text, visuals, or diagrams, making it a powerful tool for personalized learning.\n\n\n## What Are Cues in Cornell Notes and Do They Have to Be Questions?\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/XRpzpH2LY7SvmoGZDeRPXQTtDq7UHPJssVQmSvJ_fVU=\"\n  alt=\"Cornell Notes Template\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nCues in [Cornell Notes](https://affine.pro/templates/category-cornell-notes-template) are prompts or reminders written in the left-hand margin that help you recall and review the main content of your notes. They’re typically used to summarize, highlight key ideas, or generate questions that aid in understanding and retention. While many people use questions as cues because they encourage active engagement with the material, cues do not always have to be questions. They can also be keywords, phrases, or symbols that jog your memory, helping you review the material more effectively.\n\n\nAFFiNE’s canvas-based note-taking tool allows you to experiment with different types of cues beyond just questions. You can visually organize your notes and cues using text, images, or even diagrams, giving you greater flexibility in how you engage with and remember information.\n\n\n### Understanding the Role of Cues\n\n\nCues in the [Cornell Note-Taking method](https://affine.pro/templates/category-cornell-notes-template) refer to the space on the left-hand margin of your notes where you summarize or highlight key points, prompts, or questions related to the main content. Traditionally, this area is used for questions that help trigger recall during review sessions, encouraging active engagement with the material. These questions are designed to stimulate critical thinking, guiding students to reflect on the information and prepare for tests or discussions.\n\n\n### The Flexibility of Cues\n\n\nWhile the traditional approach often emphasizes using questions as cues, there’s flexibility in what cues can represent. They don’t always need to be questions—cues can also include keywords, symbols, brief summaries, or visual elements that help jog your memory and make reviewing your notes easier.\n\n\nThe purpose of cues is to encourage deeper engagement and make the review process more effective, and that can be done with various formats. With AFFiNE’s canvas-based note-taking, users can go beyond rigid formats and experiment with different types of cues, whether it’s through diagrams, visual markers, or custom symbols.\n\n\n## Exploring Best Practices for Effective Cues in Cornell Notes\n\n\nExploring best practices for effective cues in Cornell Notes involves understanding the purpose of cues and how they can enhance learning. Traditionally, cues are placed in the left-hand margin and are often questions designed to trigger recall and reflection on key points from the main notes. However, effective cues don’t always need to be questions—they can be keywords, symbols, or short summaries that prompt deeper thinking or connections between concepts.\n\n\nFor maximum effectiveness, cues should be concise and directly related to the core information. The goal is to make it easier for students or note-takers to review and engage with the material, transforming passive note-taking into an active learning tool. Using tools like AFFiNE’s canvas can also elevate the process, allowing users to experiment with more visual and creative cues.\n\n\n### Using Keywords and Summaries as Cues\n\n\nWhile questions are a common format for cues in Cornell Notes, keywords, phrases, and short summaries can be equally effective, depending on the context. Keywords serve as quick triggers for recalling important definitions, concepts, or names, making them ideal for subjects that require memorization or quick reference. Summaries, on the other hand, allow users to condense larger sections of information into concise points, which can help with understanding broader topics or connecting ideas across a lesson.\n\n\nIn situations where speed and efficiency are crucial—such as during exam preparation or when reviewing large volumes of material—keywords and summaries often work better than questions. They provide a direct path to the core information without the need for additional prompts, making note-taking more adaptable and personalized.\n\n\n### Adapting Cues to Your Workflow with AFFiNE’s Canvas\n\n\nAFFiNE’s canvas revolutionizes the note-taking process by providing an open, visual space where users can create cues in a way that best suits their individual workflows. Whether you prefer crafting questions, highlighting keywords, or incorporating visuals, the canvas allows for seamless integration of various cue types, making it a versatile tool for any learning style. This flexibility encourages users to think creatively about how they organize their notes, moving beyond traditional structures to enhance understanding and retention.\n\n\nMoreover, AFFiNE enables users to visually structure their cues within their notes, allowing for a more personalized learning experience. By utilizing the canvas’s layout options, you can position your cues to enhance connectivity between concepts, create visual hierarchies, or even group related ideas together. This dynamic approach not only fosters engagement but also aids in memory recall, ultimately leading to more effective learning outcomes.\n\n\n## How AFFiNE’s Canvas Feature Enhances the Cornell Note-Taking Process\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/iFKXquk-iRxVs5AcSBiIoYuVjcfjhhJE54OR0NVSvAI=\"\n  alt=\"Cavas Cornell Note Template\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nAFFiNE integrates seamlessly with various digital tools and resources, making it easy to enhance your [Cornell Notes Template](https://affine.pro/templates/cornell-note-template) with multimedia elements or linked references.

With AFFiNE, cues are not limited to just questions—they can be modified into phrases, keywords, or even color-coded elements that enhance clarity and retention. This adaptability allows cues to better suit individual learning needs or the complexity of the subject matter.\n\n\nThe edgeless canvas feature in AFFiNE allows users to visually organize their cues alongside notes, diagrams, and other visual aids.

Unlike traditional text-only formats, AFFiNE’s canvas allows you to incorporate diagrams, mind maps, and visual markers alongside your cues, making it easier to organize and retain information.\n\n\nAdditionally, the seamless transition between canvas and page doc views lets users switch fluidly between structured note-taking and freeform brainstorming, enabling a more dynamic approach to learning. This flexibility makes cues in AFFiNE not only more engaging but also more adaptable to different learning styles and needs.\n\n\n### Encouraging Creativity and Critical Thinking\n\n\nAFFiNE’s canvas empowers users to unleash their creativity when developing cues, fostering a deeper engagement with the material. Unlike traditional note-taking methods, which often confine users to rigid structures, the canvas encourages exploration and innovation in cue creation. Users can experiment with various formats, such as mixing text-based questions with colorful diagrams or illustrations that represent key concepts. This dynamic environment stimulates critical thinking, allowing learners to interact with the content more meaningfully and encouraging them to make connections between ideas.\n\n\nFurthermore, by integrating both questions and visual aids, AFFiNE accommodates a diverse range of learning styles, particularly for visual and kinesthetic learners. Visual learners benefit from graphics and charts that enhance their understanding of complex topics, while kinesthetic learners can use interactive elements, such as dragging and dropping visual cues or manipulating the layout of their notes, to reinforce their learning experience. This multi-modal approach not only enriches the overall learning process but also helps students retain information more effectively, as they can engage with the material in a way that resonates with their unique learning preferences.\n\n\n## Conclusion: Cues in Cornell Notes Can Be More Than Just Questions\n\n\nIn conclusion, cues in Cornell Notes offer remarkable flexibility and don’t have to be limited to questions alone.
