Here are the essential components that your template should include:\n\n\n### Applicant Information Section\n\n\nThis section should capture all relevant details about the applicant, such as their name, contact information, business type, and financial background. By having a dedicated space for this information, you can ensure that every credit application starts with complete and accurate details, making it easier to move forward with the evaluation process.\n\n\n### Financial Documentation Checklist\n\n\nThis area lists all the required documents that need to be submitted with the credit application, including bank statements, income statements, balance sheets, and tax returns. Having a clear checklist ensures that the necessary financial documentation is provided upfront, reducing delays and ensuring that decisions are made based on comprehensive data.\n\n\n### Credit Scoring and Risk Assessment\n\n\nThis section is critical for evaluating the applicant’s creditworthiness.
