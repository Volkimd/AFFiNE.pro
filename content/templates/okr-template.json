We care our windows users, and we believe this will be fixed soon in the stable version.\n\n  * **In addition, using the export single db and throwing it to the network disk for automatic sync is not recommended, it might cause some unexpected results.**\n\n\n![LiGCCCf1XYNYNAkdLgh1FzGf8wSmVnIsfLekiMBuiOk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/LiGCCCf1XYNYNAkdLgh1FzGf8wSmVnIsfLekiMBuiOk=.webp)\n\n* **Database**\n\n  * Easily create, organize, and track your data like never before.
